</div><div class='unindent'><br /><br />HERE are few of the little readers of "The
Nursery" who could not tell of pleasant days
spent among green fields and woods, or on the
seashore. But in almost every large city, there
are many children who have never been out of
sight of brick walls.</div>

<p>Their homes are in close rooms in narrow streets, and
there they live from one year's end to the other. In winter
they are often pinched with cold. In summer they suffer
even more from the heat. You may see them at windows
and doors, or on hot sidewalks, trying to get a breath of
fresh air. It is not pure air, but the best they can get.</p>

<p>What I am going to tell you is about two of those poor
children. One is a little girl, nine years old, whom we will
call Jane. The other, who is only eight years old, is her
brother George.</p>

<p>Both children go to a Sunday school, and have for their
teacher a kind lady, who takes great interest in them. One
warm summer day, to their great delight, this lady, whom
we will name Miss White, called for them to go with her on
a trip to the seashore.</p>

<p>Dressed in the best clothes they could muster, they were
soon on board the steamboat. Here every thing was new
to them. As the boat steamed down the harbor, it would
have been joy to anybody only to watch the happy expression
on their faces.</p>

<p>By and by the boat neared the land; and there the
children saw a wonderful sight. What do you suppose it
was? It was a cow quietly feeding on the shore. They
had never seen a cow before.</p>

<p>Then Jane got sight of an apple-tree, and George spied a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
man raking hay. Here was another new sensation. While
they were feasting their eyes on green fields, and inhaling
the sweet country air, the boat stopped at the wharf.</p>

<p>A few steps brought them to the beach; and there,
stretched before them, was the great wide ocean, with the
surf rolling in, and a cool sea-breeze blowing. Then their
joy knew no bounds. Miss White did not try to restrain
them; for she meant to give them at least one day of
perfect freedom.</p>

<p>So they roamed at will. How they dug wells in the
sand, how they flung stones into the water, how they picked
up shells and sea-weed, how they scrambled over the rocks,
it would take too much space to tell.</p>

<p>When they were well tired out, and began to be hungry,
Miss White opened a luncheon-box in a shady place among
the rocks, and gave them such a dinner as they had never
had before. Then their bliss was complete.</p>

<p>The day passed away almost too quickly, and the time
came to go back to the city. That seemed rather hard to
Jane and George. But they have the promise of another
excursion before the summer is over.</p>

<h2>BUTTERCUP AND DAISY.</h2>


<p><i>Dear little Readers of "The Nursery:"</i>&mdash;I would like to
tell you a story about my little brother Clinton and myself.
We each have a nice little calf down at our grandpa's farm
in the country. One is a pure Alderney, grandpa says, and
is of a beautiful fawn color: the other is red and white.
Grandpa let us name them: so we called them Buttercup
and Daisy. Clinton's is Buttercup, and mine is Daisy.</p>

<p>They are both very kind and gentle. Both have cunning
little horns, just coming out of their heads; but they do not
hook little brother or me. In the picture you will see them
eating corn out of our hands.</p>

<p>At first we were afraid of their damp noses and rough
tongues; but we soon got over that, and now feed them
every time we go to the farm.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>Papa tried to have the little Alderney give us a ride on
its back; but, as soon as we were well on, the calf kicked up
its heels and ran away, saying, "Bah!" and leaving brother
and me on our backs on the soft turf. We were not hurt
at all, but had a good laugh.</p>

<p>Buttercup soon came back for more corn; and uncle said,
"Give it to her in the ear;" but I said I thought her mouth
was the best place to put it in. Then uncle laughed, and
said that was a joke. Do you know what he meant?</p>

<h2>AUNT MARY'S BULLFINCH.</h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Now</span> be sure and not frighten it, children," said Aunt
Mary as she left the room.</p>

<p>John and Lucy lifted the handkerchief from the cage,
while Paul and Richard, with anxious eyes, stood by to get
a sight of the piping bullfinch, of which they had heard so
much.</p>

<p>This little bird had been presented to Aunt Mary by a
German lady to whom she had been kind. It could whistle
two or three tunes in a way to surprise all hearers. While
the children were looking at it, it began to pipe.</p>

<p>"I know that tune," cried Richard. "It is 'Coming
through the rye!'"</p>

<p>"And now the tune changes to 'Merrily every bosom
boundeth,'" said Lucy. "What a wonderful little bird!"</p>

<p>"But how did it learn to whistle these tunes?" asked
Paul.</p>

<p>Aunt Mary, coming in at that moment, explained to the
children that in some of the small towns of Germany are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
persons who teach these little birds. It takes about a year
for a bullfinch to learn a tune. But some of them learn
more quickly than others: so it is with some children.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 336px;">
<img src="images/illus039.png" width="336" height="400" alt="Looking at the bullfinch" title="" />
</div>

<p>The birds are at first kept in a dark room; and when
they are fed, a tune is played or whistled. They associate
this tune with the act of feeding; and gradually seem to
find out what is wanted of them.</p>

<p>The price of a bird that can pipe a tune in good style is
from fifty to one hundred dollars. A good deal of time and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
trouble has to be spent in teaching the birds. Sometimes a
child is employed to play a tune on a little hand-organ; and
this the little bird learns after hearing it many times.</p>

<p>When the bullfinch learns well, he is praised and petted,
and this he seems to enjoy very much. Even birds, you
see, like to be praised and petted.</p>

<h2>THE POOR MAN'S WELL.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Among</span> the Azores, is situated the beautiful Island of
Fayal, with its orange-groves and profusion of flowers.
But, notwithstanding the fruit and flowers, there is one
thing which Americans who live there miss sadly, and that
is fresh, cool water. There are no lakes or ponds, such
as we have here; and so the people have to use rain-water,
which they save in large tanks or cisterns.</p>

<p>There are a few wells on the island, which, as the water
rises and falls in them twice in every twenty-four hours,
are called "tide-wells." But there was a time, many years
ago, when the people had neither cisterns nor wells, and
were obliged to get water from hollows in the rocks. And
this is the story of the first well.</p>

<p>The year 1699 was a year when scarcely any rain fell.
The grain did not grow, the cows and sheep died from thirst,
and many of the poor people also. Now there was a very
rich man on the island, who had come here to live many
years before, from another part of the world.</p>

<p>Though he was so rich, and might have done much good
with his money, he was so stingy and so hard, that the
people did not love him at all. But his bags of silver and
gold did not buy him water; and at last the thought came
to him, "Why! I will dig a well, as people used to do in
my country. I will dig it on my own land, and no one
shall have a drop of the water but myself."</p>

<p>So he hired men to come and dig the well; but he paid
them only a little money, and was very unkind to them.
They dug and they dug; but no water came. At last they
said they would work no longer unless their master would
promise them some of the water, and he promised them the
use of the well for half of every day.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus044.png" width="500" height="377" alt="Lower and lower in the well" title="" />
</div>

<p>Now they dug with more patience; and one morning, as
early as six o'clock, they suddenly found water. They
claimed the privilege of using the well for the first six
hours; and the master dared not refuse. As they were
drawing the water, they noticed that it began to grow
lower and lower in the well; and at twelve o'clock, the
master's hour, none was left.</p>

<p>He was very, very angry, and said he would never give
the men any work again. However, at six o'clock that
night, they again demanded the use of the well. He
mockingly asked them if they expected the water would
come for them, and not for him. Nevertheless they went
to the well; and, to the master's awe and wonder, it was
full of water.</p>

<p>At midnight, the master again tried to get water from
the well, and, as before, found it empty. He now felt<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
afraid, believing that some divine power controlled the
action of the water. He went to the church and vowed,
before God, that if the water should come again next
morning, he would dedicate it to the poor forever.</p>

<p>In the morning, when the men visited the well, there
was the fresh water awaiting them. The master kept his
vow, and thus the well became "The Poor Man's Well."
To this day the water rises and falls in it twice in every
twenty-four hours. I give you here a picture of the well,
and should you ever go to Fayal you may see the original.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Can</span> you guess what she was? She was a little black
kitten; and I must tell you all about her, and why we gave
her such a funny name. Teddikins had a great mouse-colored
cat called Maltie, and she had three little kitties,&mdash;Spitfire,
Miss Tittens, and Cuddle. Spitfire was all black,
just as black as a lump of coal, while Miss Tittens was gray,
and Cuddle was gray and white.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>The first time Teddikins and I looked into the box where
Maltie and her kitties were, they were very, very little, and
their eyes were not open. The black kitty was lying on top
of the others; and Teddikins put in his little fat hand and
picked her up. What do you suppose she did? She said,
"<i>Sptss!</i>" and she kept on saying, "<i>Sptss</i>" until Teddikins
put her down again; and so we called her Spitfire.</p>

<p>Just as soon as she could see out of her funny little gray
eyes, she began to try to get out of the box. She wanted
to see what there was outside, where Maltie went. She
would climb up a little way, and then tumble back on Miss
Tittens and Cuddle, which would make them say, "Mew,"
and make Teddikins laugh; but Spitfire always said, "<i>Sptss!</i>"
and would try again.</p>

<p>At last, one day we heard a thump; and we looked
around, and there was Spitfire on the floor. She had
climbed to the top of the box, and tumbled over the edge,
and there she stood, with her tail straight in the air, and
her legs wide apart, looking at us, and saying, "<i>Sptss!</i>"</p>

<p>Maltie was very proud of her kitties, and used to take
Cuddle and Miss Tittens in her mouth, and carry them into
the dining-room when we were eating our breakfast, to
show them to us. But Spitfire would not let her mamma
carry her. She would walk in all alone, tumbling over on
her little nose very often (for her legs were not yet strong),
but carrying her little black tail just as straight as little
boys carry sticks when they call them guns.</p>

<p>One morning, Teddikins put a saucer of milk on the floor
and what do you suppose that little Spitfire did? Why,
she looked at it very hard, and then she said, "<i>Sptss</i>," and
walked right into the milk, and out the other side of the
saucer, with Tittens and Cuddle after her. The floor was
covered with the funny white prints of their little paws.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>One day a mouse ran across the kitchen; and Cuddle and
Tittens were very much frightened; but Spitfire humped
up her back, and made her tail very big, and said "<i>Sptss!</i>"
very hard, and then cantered off sideways staring at the
mouse, and saying, "<i>Sptss!</i>" all the time.</p>

<p>You know how kitties like to go to sleep, all cuddled up
together. But Spitfire would not lie down with the others:
she always tried to get on top of them.</p>

<p>When the little kitties were quite strong, they used to
play a funny sort of game. There was a round foot-stool,
covered with carpet, and Spitfire used to sit up on it, and
then Cuddle and Miss Tittens would try to climb up the
sides. Then Spitfire would say, "<i>Sptss!</i>" and pat them on
the heads with her little paws until they rolled down again.
Sometimes, when she was busy driving one off, another
would get up behind her, and drive her off too; but she
always worked hard until she was up again.</p>

<p>Do you not think she was a funny kitty? She always
went first, and took the lead, and used to box the ears of
Cuddle and Tittens when they did not mind her. Now she
is a big black cat, with a red collar around her neck, and
she catches rats and mice, and is very good and useful.
She only says, "<i>Sptss!</i>" when strange cats come into her
yard; but we still call her Spitfire.</p>

<h2>THE COSSET-CALF.</h2>


<div class='poem'>
<span class="smcap">When</span> I was quite a little girl<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I had a cosset-calf,</span><br />
And, when it ran about the fields,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">It always made me laugh.</span><br />
<br />
It seemed as gentle as a lamb,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And from my hand was fed;</span><br />
And how I grieved when first I felt<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The horns upon its head!</span><br />
<br />
It always answered to my call,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And thrust its wet nose through</span><br />
The bars, and tried its very best<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To say, "How do you do?"</span><br />
<br />
I left it in the early fall,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And kissed my pet with tears;</span><br />
For to a little child the months<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Stretch out as long as years.</span><br />
<br />
And when the summer came again,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I never shall forget</span><br />
With what dismay I gazed upon<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My former little pet.</span><br />
<br />
I was afraid of those great horns,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So crooked on its brow,</span><br />
Nor would believe my little calf<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Was that enormous cow!</span><br />
<br />
But soon I learned to know its face<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And conquered my alarm,</span><br />
And thought there was no nicer cow<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On any other farm.</span><br />
<br />
And oh the rich sweet milk she gave!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Why, just to make me laugh,</span><br />
My mother used to call me then<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Her little cosset-calf!</span><br />

<h2>"GREAT I AND LITTLE YOU."</h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">How</span> do you like that little new neighbor of yours?"
asked Herbert Greene's big brother, who had seen the two
little boys playing together in the yard.</p>

<p>"Oh, you must mean Georgie Worthman," said Herbie.
"Why, I don't know. I like him, and I don't like him."</p>

<p>Wallace laughed. "Then you quarrel a little sometimes,"
said he. "Is that it?"</p>

<p>"No, we don't quarrel," said Herbie. "I don't let him
know when I'm mad with him."</p>

<p>"What does he do to make you mad with him?" asked
Wallace.</p>

<p>"Oh, he says things," said Herbie.</p>

<p>"Such as what?"</p>

<p>"Well, he looks at my marbles, and says, 'Is that all
you've got? I have five times as many as that,&mdash;splendid
ones, too. They'd knock those all to smash.'"</p>

<p>"Ah, I see!" said Wallace. "It is a clear case of '<i>great
I and little you</i>.'"</p>

<p>"What do you mean by that?" said Herbie.</p>

<p>"Well, if you don't find out by Saturday night, I'll tell
you," said Wallace. This was on Monday.</p>

<p>On Wednesday afternoon Herbie was out at play, and
presently Georgie Worthman came out. Wallace was in
his room, reading, with the windows open, and could hear
all that was said.</p>

<p>Georgie brought his kite with him, and asked Herbie if
he would go to the common with him to fly his kite.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes! if mother is willing," said Herbie. "But
where did you get that kite?&mdash;made it yourself, didn't
you? I've got one ever so much bigger than that, with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
yards and yards of tail, and, when we let it out, it goes out
of sight quick,&mdash;now, I tell you!"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus051.png" width="500" height="379" alt="Fishing" title="" />
</div>

<p>"This isn't the best I can make," said Georgie; "but if
I had a bigger one I couldn't pitch it, or hold it after it
was up."</p>

<p>"Pooh! I could hold one that pulled like ten horses,"
said Herbie; and he ran in to ask his mother if he could go
with Georgie to the common.</p>

<p>His mother was willing if Wallace would go too; and so,
after a little good-natured bothering, and pretending he did
not want to go, Wallace took his hat, and Herbie got his
kite and twine, and the three boys set off for the common.</p>

<p>Georgie's kite was pitched first, and went up in fine style.
Then Herbie's went off, and soon passed it, for it had a
longer string; and both were far up in the dazzling blue of
the sky.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>"There now!" said Herbie, "didn't I tell you my kite
would beat yours all to nothing? I bet there isn't another
kite in town that will begin to be a match for it!"</p>

<p>"How is this? How is this?" said Wallace. "Seems to
me 'great I and little you' are around here pretty thick."</p>

<p>"What do you mean by that?" said both the little boys.</p>

<p>"Why, when a fellow says that he has got the best
marbles, and the best kite, and the swiftest sled, and the
handsomest velocipede, and the most knowing dog, anywhere
in town, we say his talk is all '<i>great I and little
you</i>.' That is, we mean he is always bragging; and a
braggart is a very disagreeable person," said Wallace.</p>

<p>Herbie looked at Georgie, and both blushed a little. The
boys had great fun with their kites; and when they got
home, and Wallace and Herbie went up stairs to put away
the kite, Herbie said, "Well, my kite did beat Georgie's,
just as I told him it would."</p>

<p>"That is true," said Wallace; "but you said the other
day that you liked Georgie, and didn't like him, because
he was always telling how much bigger and better his
things were than yours; and now, to-day, you were making
yourself disagreeable to him by bragging about your kite.
Now, if you want the boys to like you, my lad, you must
give up talking 'great I and little you,' for it is not sensible
nor kind."</p>

<p>So Herbie found out what Wallace meant, and he said to
himself, "I don't mean to let the fellows hear me talking,
'great I and little you' any more."</p>

<h2>OUR DOG TASSO.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Tasso</span> is a big black dog. His back comes up almost to
the top of a dining-table. He does not look as though he
could ever have been carried about in a handkerchief; but,
when he was a puppy, he was brought home in that way
by a young lady as a present to her brothers.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>Tasso seems to take delight in making himself useful.
When there is work to be done, he always wants to do his
part. He brings in wood, stick by stick, and puts it in the
wood-box, never stopping till the box is full. While he
is carrying in the wood, the boys fill the chip-basket; and
then Tasso takes that in his mouth, and puts it in its place
beside the wood-box.</p>

<p>If any of the family has a basket or a bag to take to the
station, Tasso always insists on taking it. One rainy day,
we sent him to the station with three umbrellas, and he
delivered them all safely. One day his master went out to
the barn without his hat. Tasso did not think this was
proper: so he took the hat in his mouth and carried it out
to him.</p>

<p>I could tell you many other amusing things about Tasso.
He is always attentive and obedient, and every one who
knows him loves him and trusts him.</p>

<h2>MY PETS.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">I am</span> a little girl seven years old. I live way up in the
woods of Maine, in the little town of Howland, forty miles
from anywhere. Now you may wonder how I can amuse
myself, so far away from the world: so I am going to tell
you.</p>

<p>I live on a great farm, with grandpapa, Aunt Peeps, and
Nan, and Will. I have a pair of top-boots, so I can play
out doors in wet weather. I was glad when grandpapa
brought them home; and the first thing I did was to find
a good large mud-puddle, and oh! didn't I have fun, splashing
right through it!</p>

<p>I drive old Frank whenever I please; and then, when we
get home, I feed him on apples and bread. He is twenty
years old, and has no teeth to eat hay with, and grandpapa
says he would starve to death if it were not for me.</p>

<p>We let him go wherever he likes, and in hot weather he
stays on the barn-floor, out of the reach of the flies, most of
the time. He lets me card him, and he never kicks me.
One day last summer, Emma and I got old Frank upon a
haymow, about four feet from the floor, and there he lay
down on his side, and took a nap. Then I brought out a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
pan of meal and water, and fed it to him with an iron
spoon.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus057.png" width="500" height="381" alt="Frank on the floor" title="" />
</div>

<p>I have an old pet sheep too. It will run out from the
flock any time when it sees me coming, and follow me to
the house. One day I heard a noise against the kitchen-door,
and, when I opened it, my sheep came in, and followed
me right into the dining-room, and would not go out till I
gave it some potatoes.</p>

<p>Major and Velvet Paw are my pet cats, and Peep is my
German canary-bird; and I had a pet chicken, but grandpapa
stepped on it one day. He says he would rather have
lost the best cow in the barn than have killed my chicken.
William says he will give me four eggs in the spring, and
then, perhaps, I can have four chickens instead of one.</p>

<p>I have a bear,&mdash;a black, fierce-eyed bear, that gnashes
his teeth, and growls, and stands up and shakes his paws at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
me; but he is not a <i>real live bear</i>. He has to be wound
up with a key before he will growl. We have live bears
here in the woods, though: they come right into our yard,
and eat our sheep. We set a trap for one last fall, close to
the house, and a bear was caught in it.</p>

<p>I have a wax doll almost as large as a real baby. I have
named it Gretchen. Cousin Mary brought it to me from
Germany. It has flaxen curls, and six of the prettiest little
pearl teeth, and it goes to sleep, and says papa and mamma,
and whines, and cries. I wonder if any of you little girls
have such a beautiful dolly.</p>

<p>My doll, Rosie Deben, is six years old, and almost as
large as I am. I wash her whenever I like, and about once
a year Auntie Peeps paints her face over. I like Rosie for
an every-day doll, because I can wash her hands and face,
and undress her, and if she tumbles out of her wagon it only
bumps her head, and bruises her nose. She has tumbled
down stairs ever so many times.</p>

<p>I have no little girls to play with; but there is a little
boy who comes to see me sometimes: his name is Percy,
and we go fishing down at the brook, and we catch little
bits of fish with pin hooks.</p>

<p>I went to school last summer, and read in my "Nursery,"
and Nan said I learned nicely. There were only four
scholars,&mdash;one for each corner of the room; and we had a
little rocking-chair to sit in.</p>

<p>Nan thinks I have told you enough about my pets this
time, and I will bid you good-by.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Here</span> is Corporal Hans drilling a squad under the eye of
his superior officer, Captain Ernest. The corporal is a
brave soldier. Anybody could tell that by his looks. But
he does not give his orders quite sternly enough to suit the
captain, who is teaching him how to do it.</p>

<p>It makes a man of peace shudder to see the corporal
stand so calmly right at the mouth of a cannon. What if
the cannon should go off! But these military men get used
to such things. I don't suppose now that one of that whole
squad could be frightened into running away. They will
not move till they hear the word of command.</p>

has a very
long tail and
also a long
thick mane.
He stands
very quietly

<p>The next picture shows us
two donkeys,&mdash;an old one and
a young one. They have very
long ears, and look as if they
might hear
all that we
say.</p>



<p>The worst
we can say
of them or
their race is
that they are
homely, and
not so fleet
as the horse. But they are
very tough and strong and
patient.</p>

<h2>A BLACKSMITH'S SONG.</h2>


<div class='poem2'>
<span style="margin-left: 5em;"><span class="smcap">Clang</span>, cling, clang, cling!</span><br />
Bellows, you must roar, and anvil, you must ring;<br />
Hammer, you and I must work&mdash;for ding, dong, ding<br />
Must dress my Kate and baby, and bread for us must bring.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">So dong, ding, dong, ding!</span><br />
Anvil, to my hammer make music while I sing,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">Clang, cling, clang, cling!</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">Clang, cling, clang, cling!</span><br />
Oh, well I love my smithy when the birds in spring-time sing,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>And the pleasant sun comes streaming in, the sun that loves to bring<br />
Its gladness to me, working, and to hear my anvil ring.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">Dong, ding, dong, ding!</span><br />
And to see my iron glowing, and the sparks in showers spring,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">Clang, cling, clang, cling!</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">Blow, blow, blow, blow!</span><br />
Bellows, you must work till the furnace is aglow.<br />
Snug is my old smithy when, without, comes down the snow,<br />
When sooty wall and rafter in the blaze are all aglow.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">Blow, blow, blow, blow!</span><br />
What care I if the storm, then, without, be high or low?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">Blow, blow, blow, blow!</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">Clang, cling, clang, cling!</span><br />
Merrily the hours fly that hear my anvil ring;<br />
And quick my evening chair and my evening meal they bring;<br />
Then, while Kate works beside me, I'm as happy as a king.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">Clang, cling, clang, cling!</span><br />
God give me always health and strength to make my anvil ring:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">Clang, cling, clang, cling!</span><br />

1. Good-Day! Madam Quack with your young in your track,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Quite early they're out,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">What are they about&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Those bright little things</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With their short downy wings?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I'm glad of your luck, you're a good mother duck!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And if young folks did know half the joy they bestow</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When attentive and good&mdash;they would try all they could.</span><br />
<br />
2. You know sir, I see what young ducklings should be;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Your taste I commend,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My civil young friend;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They're beauties you see and obedient to me.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In ponds they can paddle,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On land they can waddle,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They dive and they flutter,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Quack, quack, they can utter:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I'm glad they can learn, and great fame they will earn.</span><br />
